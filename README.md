# README for Assignment3

## continued from hw2: add server part& additional work in frontend
Actually, I want to continue with the assignment 2 repository, 
but I should merge the whole note-app (frontend part), so I just made the new repository for this assignment. 
First of all, I made the server part, which is the backend part with the professor's example code. 
And I worked on some additional frontend works. 
## making API
For connecting, I was making API. But I did not finish yet. 
## Delete note-app/node_modules directory & Delete server/node_modules directory
Before completely making API, I release that the node_modules were in the repository. So I deleted it. 
## made API
I finished making API!
## delete~
I just copy and paste the ".gitignore" file, so the node_modules from the server and note-app did not work. 

#### before
```
# dependencies
/node_modules
/.pnp
```
#### after
```
# dependencies
/server/node_modules
/note-app/node_modules
/.pnp
```
## connect front and back(add/delete/save)
I deleted local storage and connect it with API. I worked on the main function. (create, add, and delete notes)

## connect front and back(user)
I deleted local storage and connect it with API. I worked on the user part. (create, add, and delete notes)

## Handle some minor issues
I had some minor errors, so I fixed! 


# README for Assignment4

## make login & signup page / make login and signup page
I commited twice because I thought it did not push. For here, I made login and signup page just for frontend

## connect back and front: login & signup
I connected backend and frontend for login and sign up

## completed logout, connect each user and each notepad
I made whole functions for logout, login. And also I dealt with multiple users. 

## Determining Related Notes
With universalSentenceEncoder.js, I dealt with similarity. However, it really slow to selecte similar notes.

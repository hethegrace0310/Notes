# README for assignment 2 / Ha-Eun Park

I will explain in the order of commit that I did.

## first commit

- Before explaining the first commit I had a problem with branches.
  When I first made the repository for assignment 2, I committed to the 'main' branch. However, at the second commit, my files were saved at the 'master' branch. I tried to merge them, but I realized it will be better to make a new repository. Therefore, I deleted whole files and made the new repository.
- I did the first commit for my assignment with the message "first commit." It is the react version for assignment 1.

## problem 4) progressing

- For this commit, I made the media query works by giving an onClick event.

## problem 3) making DB: complete

- For this commit, I made DB for my notepad with local storage. I thought that was all I have to do, but I realized I had to make DB for the profile.

## problem 3) final version

- So, I made DB for the profile and it worked well!

## Problem 4) complete

- For this commit, I completed making the media query event. And I had trouble with 'clicking a note shows the note'. I made it with 'double click' before, but I fixed it just click it. (by giving two events when a note get onClick)
